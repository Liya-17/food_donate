## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Match Scoring Algorithm

**8 Factors Considered:**

1. **Dietary Preferences** (30 points)
   - Matches food type with user's dietary needs
   - Perfect match: 30/30, Mismatch: 0/30

2. **Food Category** (20 points)
   - Matches donation category with preferences
   - In preferred list: 20/20, Not preferred: 0/20

3. **Distance** (25 points)
   - Exponential decay based on distance
   - Closer = higher score
   - Respects max distance setting

4. **Servings/Quantity** (15 points)
   - Matches donation servings with user needs
   - Perfect fit: 15/15, Partial: 5-10/15

5. **Urgency** (10 points)
   - Boosts urgent donations
   - Expiring soon: 10/10, Normal: 5/10

6. **Historical Success** (15 points)
   - Rewards receivers with good claim history
   - Based on success rate

7. **Donor Rating** (10 points)
   - Higher rated donors get boost
   - 5-star donor: 10/10, 3-star: 6/10

8. **Time of Day** (10 points)
   - Matches preferred pickup times
   - Preferred time: 10/10, Other: 5/10

**Total Possible**: 155 points → Normalized to 100%

**Match Levels:**
- 85-100%: Perfect Match 🎯
- 70-84%: Excellent Match ⭐
- 55-69%: Good Match 👍
- 40-54%: Fair Match ✓
