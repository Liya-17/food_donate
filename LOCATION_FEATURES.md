# Location Features Enhancement

## Overview

The food donation platform now includes comprehensive location-based features to help users find donations near them and specify precise pickup locations.

## New Features Added

### 1. LocationPicker Component (`frontend/src/components/LocationPicker.jsx`)

A comprehensive location picker with multiple input methods:

**Features:**
- âœ… **Current Location Detection** - One-click button to get user's GPS location
- âœ… **Address Search** - Search for locations by typing an address
- âœ… **Manual Coordinates** - Enter latitude/longitude manually
- âœ… **Reverse Geocoding** - Shows readable address from coordinates
- âœ… **Map Preview** - Link to view location on Google Maps
- âœ… **OpenStreetMap Integration** - Free geocoding service (no API key needed)

**Technologies:**
- Browser Geolocation API
- OpenStreetMap Nominatim for geocoding
- Real-time coordinate validation

### 2. Enhanced CreateDonation Form

**Location Picking:**
- Integrated LocationPicker component
- Three ways to set location:
  1. Use current location (GPS)
  2. Search by address
  3. Manual lat/long input
- Visual feedback with detected address
- Coordinates automatically sent to backend

**How to Use:**
1. Click "Create Donation"
2. Fill in donation details
3. In the Location section:
   - Click "Use Current Location" for GPS
   - OR type an address and click search
   - OR manually enter coordinates
4. See detected location displayed
5. Submit the form

### 3. Distance-Based Filtering in DonationsList

**Find Nearby Donations:**
- Click "Find Nearby Donations" button
- Automatically detects your location
- Shows donations sorted by distance
- Adjustable distance radius:
  - 1 km
  - 5 km
  - 10 km (default)
  - 25 km
  - 50 km
  - 100 km

**Distance Display:**
- Shows "X km away" on each donation card
- Only shown when location filter is active
- Uses accurate distance calculation

**Features:**
- Blue highlight for location filter active
- "Clear Location" button to remove filter
- Distance dropdown selector
- Real-time filtering as you adjust distance

### 4. Map View for Donations

**Interactive Map:**
- Toggle between List and Map view
- Shows all donations with valid coordinates
- Embedded OpenStreetMap iframe
- Click on donations to see details
- Direct links to Google Maps

**Features:**
- "Show Map" / "Show List" toggle button
- Centered on donation cluster
- List of donations below map
- Quick "View" links to Google Maps

### 5. Enhanced Location Display in DonationDetail

**Map Integration:**
- Embedded mini-map showing exact location
- "Open in Google Maps" button
- "Get Directions" button (opens Google Maps navigation)
- Visual map preview using OpenStreetMap

**Features:**
- Interactive map embedded in page
- One-click navigation
- Clear address display
- Map only shows if coordinates exist

## How Location Works

### Data Flow

1. **User Input:**
   - GPS coordinates from browser
   - OR address search â†’ geocoded to coordinates
   - OR manual lat/long entry

2. **Stored in Database:**
   ```javascript
   pickupLocation: {
     address: {
       street, city, state, zipCode
     },
     coordinates: {
       type: 'Point',
       coordinates: [longitude, latitude]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Query Nearby:**
   - Backend uses MongoDB geospatial queries
   - `$near` operator for distance-based search
   - Returns donations sorted by distance

### Distance Calculation

Uses Haversine formula to calculate distance between two points on Earth:

```javascript
calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)
// Returns distance in kilometers
```

## API Endpoints Enhanced

### Create Donation
```
POST /api/donations
Body includes:
- latitude (optional)
- longitude (optional)
- pickupLocation.address (optional)
```

### Get Donations with Location Filter
```
GET /api/donations?latitude=40.7128&longitude=-74.0060&distance=10000
Returns donations within 10km of coordinates
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Enhancement:
- No location picker
- No way to find nearby donations
- Manual address entry only
- No map visualization

### After Enhancement:
- âœ… One-click location detection
- âœ… Find donations near you instantly
- âœ… See distances on donation cards
- âœ… Map view of all donations
- âœ… Embedded maps on detail pages
- âœ… Direct navigation links
- âœ… Address search functionality

## Technical Details

### APIs Used (All Free!)

1. **Browser Geolocation API**
   - Gets user's GPS coordinates
   - Requires HTTPS in production
   - User permission required

2. **OpenStreetMap Nominatim**
   - Geocoding (address â†’ coordinates)
   - Reverse geocoding (coordinates â†’ address)
   - No API key needed
   - Rate limited (1 req/sec)

3. **OpenStreetMap Embed**
   - Free map iframes
   - No API key required
   - No usage limits

4. **Google Maps Links**
   - Opens in new tab
   - Uses Google Maps mobile app if available
   - Navigation links

### MongoDB Geospatial Queries

The backend uses MongoDB's geospatial capabilities:

```javascript
// Index created on coordinates
donationSchema.index({ 'pickupLocation.coordinates': '2dsphere' });

// Query nearby donations
Donation.find({
  'pickupLocation.coordinates': {
    $near: {
      $geometry: {
        type: 'Point',
        coordinates: [longitude, latitude]
      },
      $maxDistance: distanceInMeters
    }
  }
})
```
